# 2 of 100 Days

Today is the second day. That's great. The second step of my 100 days journey. Let's gooo!!

## Learned

- JavaScript higher order functions and array
	+ `forEach` `filer` `map` `sort` `reduce` 
	+ ```javascript
			keyArr = ['name', 'age', 'pet']
			valueArr= ['Mink', 23, 'joey']
			
			const personObj = keyArr.reduce((accu, item, index) => {
				return {...accu, [item]: valueArr[index]}
			},{});
		```

- I think I should learn some database knowledge. I choose MongoDB. It's like JSON format but can done CURD operation for database. Really good! Easy for who know javaScript.
- Continue js for beginner from Bro Code. He is very good, I think.
- Make a project called color flipper. Contain a button and when it is clicked the backgroundColor change.
