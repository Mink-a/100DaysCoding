# 005 of 100 Day

I think I know alot. But I am not using them. So I can't measure my knowledge. I should do more thinking and more coding. I want to be THE BEST DEVELOPER. I need to push myself. Let's gooo!!!

## learned
- More about JSON
  + datatypes `str, num, boo, arr, obj, null`
  + key-value pair/ double quotes
  + ```{"name": "Mink", "age": 20, "todo": ["note", "beer"], "addr": {"street": "123rd", "city":"NY",},}```
- I had done this yesterday. But in my town, electricity and internet cutoff for the whole day. I can't make it post to github.
