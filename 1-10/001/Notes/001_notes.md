# 1 Of 100

This is 1st day of 100Days coding challenge.
I will code at least 1 hour a day for 100 days.

Learn new things and practice the old knowledge.
Each single day, I will note the things I learn and keep in Notes.
I will do one project per day. Let's gooo!!!

## Learning

- Refresh my `git` knowledge
	+ `git log --pretty=oneline` `git log --pretty=format:'<format-string>'`
	+ `git status` `git branch` `git push` 

- I decidet to dive deeper in JS theory. Take a course on YouTube JS for Beginners. It will take 8 hours so I will do in 3 or 4 days. Let's start! I forgot to mention the youtuber. The name is `Bro Code`.
